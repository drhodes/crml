CRML - Chrome Media Library

A game library for google native client.

Aims to target a very specific configuration of interop between
javascript and NaCl, one where most everything happens in the nexe.

binary resources are encoded and passed to the nexe and stored in a
moc filesystem, which is really just a map<string filename, string filebytes>

libpng can read char* similar to FILE.
other libraries do too, so hopefully the filesystem limitation won't be 
too big of an issue for reusing established libraries for manipulating
other media resources as well: ogg, svg...
