(v) embed lua
	ok, but need to work up a scripting console
	like quake ~?
	
	options for including lua code since runtime filesystem
	access isn't allowed? 

	Probably just pass it down into map<string filename.lua, string filecontents>
    And then from there interpret?

	
	build time script that transformms lua source into
	C code, something like
	
	-- file1.lua
	def addone(x)
		return x+1
	end
	
	...
	
	string file1 = "def func(x) return x+1; end;"
	Because white space is insignicant this will work!
	so replace new line with semicolons and save out
	as file1_lua.cc	

	need to watch out for escape chars.
	maybe there are literal quotes ``.
